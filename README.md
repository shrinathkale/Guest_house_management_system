The Guest House Management System is designed to efficiently manage and maintain records of guests staying in a guest house. The system keeps room-wise records of currently present guests and also securely stores information about previous or checked-out guests for future reference. It also shows the vaccant rooms and beds in the guest house.
This project aims to reduce manual paperwork and improve accuracy by providing a centralized and organized digital system for managing guest information, room allocation, and check-in/check-out details. It ensures easy tracking of room occupancy and guest history, making daily operations smoother and more efficient.
